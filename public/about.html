<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>Welcome to my portfolio page</h2>
<p>I'm Reka Sa, an aspiring web developer from London.</p>

<p>I started coding during the 2020 lockdown and soon realised that this is what I would like to do in the future. I completed two SheCodes courses (Basics and Plus) in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and a few FutureLearns mini courses. After life went back to normal and I returned to my full time job, I didn't have much time to continue this new hobby.</p>

<p>In the summer of 2024 I found Angela Yu's Udemy course, "The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp", which I'm doing currently.</p>
<p>This is my first portfolio.</p>
